ADVANCED REACT TOPICS:

1.React Lifecycle Methods

componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount (for class components).
Understanding their equivalents with hooks (useEffect).

2.Advanced Hooks

useContext for managing global state.
useReducer as an alternative to useState for complex state logic.
useMemo and useCallback for performance optimization.
useRef for referencing DOM elements and persisting values.
Custom hooks.

3.Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

Understanding HOCs.
