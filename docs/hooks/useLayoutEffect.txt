The useLayoutEffect hook in React is similar to useEffect, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. 
This means it is executed before the browser paints the screen.

It is useful when you need to:

1.Measure the DOM after rendering but before the user sees any updates.
2.Perform DOM operations like setting the scroll position or applying styles based on the DOM measurements.

Key Differences Between useLayoutEffect and useEffect:

1.Execution Timing:

useEffect: Fires after the paint (asynchronously).
useLayoutEffect: Fires before the paint (synchronously).

2.Use Cases:

useEffect: For side effects that donâ€™t affect the layout, like API calls or logging.
useLayoutEffect: For DOM manipulations or measurements.

When to Use useLayoutEffect:

Use useLayoutEffect only when you need to:

1.Measure DOM nodes after rendering (like size, position).
2.Synchronize a DOM mutation with a state change before the browser repaints.
3.Fix layout glitches or visual inconsistencies.

For all other side effects, prefer useEffect as it doesn't block the browser paint and improves performance.
