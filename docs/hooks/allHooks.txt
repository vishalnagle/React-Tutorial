As of React 19 (and earlier), hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of the hooks available:

Basic Hooks:

1.useState
Manages state in functional components.

2.useEffect
Handles side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

3.useContext
Provides access to the nearest Context value in the component tree.


Additional Hooks:

4.useReducer
An alternative to useState for managing more complex state logic.

5.useCallback
Memoizes a callback function, preventing unnecessary re-creations.

6.useMemo
Memoizes a value to optimize performance.

7.useRef
Creates a mutable reference object that persists across renders.

8.useImperativeHandle
Customizes the instance value exposed by useRef when using forwardRef.

9.useLayoutEffect
Similar to useEffect but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations.

10.useDebugValue
Displays a label for custom hooks in React DevTools.


Newer Hooks:

11.useTransition
Allows marking updates as non-urgent (introduced for concurrent rendering).

12.useDeferredValue
Defers a less urgent value until higher-priority updates are processed.

13.useId
Generates unique IDs that are stable across server and client renders.

14.useSyncExternalStore
A hook for subscribing to external stores in a way that supports concurrent rendering.

15.useInsertionEffect
Fires before DOM mutations and can be used for injecting styles.

Server-Specific Hooks (React 18 and Later):

16.useCacheRefresh
Used for managing cache in server components.
