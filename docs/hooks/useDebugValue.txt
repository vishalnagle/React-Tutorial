The useDebugValue hook is a React developer tool utility that allows you to display custom labels for custom hooks in React DevTools. 
This hook is purely for debugging purposes and does not affect the behavior of your application. 
It provides additional context about the state or value returned by a custom hook, making it easier to understand and debug custom hook implementations.

Syntax:

useDebugValue(value, formatFunction?)

value: The value to display in React DevTools.
formatFunction: (Optional) A function to format the value before displaying it. 
This allows you to provide more meaningful or readable information.

Why Use useDebugValue?

When using custom hooks in a complex application, it can be challenging to debug or understand the current state or value returned by the hook.
useDebugValue allows you to label or transform the value in a way that makes sense for debugging.

Key Points:

1.Limited to DevTools: useDebugValue is invisible in your application but useful for React DevTools.
2.Use for Custom Hooks: It is primarily used to provide meaningful information about custom hooks.
3.Optional Formatter: The optional formatting function allows for customization of debug information.

By using useDebugValue, you can make your debugging experience smoother and more efficient, especially in complex applications with multiple custom hooks.
