The useImperativeHandle hook in React allows you to customize the instance value that is exposed when using React.forwardRef. 
This hook is especially useful when you need to expose specific methods or properties of a component to its parent, rather than exposing the entire component instance.

Key Points:

1.Purpose: It customizes the ref object passed to a child component by its parent.
2.When to Use:
When a parent component needs to directly control or access specific functionality of a child component.
Avoid overuseâ€”prefer props and state for most interactions.
3.Parameters:
ref: The forwarded ref from React.forwardRef.
createHandle: A function that returns the object you want to expose.
dependencies: An array of dependencies to update the createHandle object.

Syntax:

useImperativeHandle(ref, () => handleObject, [dependencies]);

Best Practices:

1.Keep the API small: Only expose what is necessary to the parent.
2.Avoid misuse: Use useImperativeHandle only when you need direct interaction, not as a substitute for props.
3.Dependency management: Ensure the dependencies array is correct to avoid stale references.
