The useInsertionEffect hook in React is a low-level API introduced in React 18. 
It is specifically designed to manage style insertion into the DOM during the render phase. 
This ensures that styles are applied before the DOM mutations are made visible to the user.

Key Features of useInsertionEffect:

1.Synchronous Execution: It runs synchronously in the render phase, before layout effects (useLayoutEffect) and effects (useEffect) are executed.
2.Styling Optimization: Ideal for scenarios like dynamically injecting styles (e.g., CSS-in-JS libraries like Emotion or Styled Components).
3.Render Phase Only: This hook does not run in React's server-rendering environment as it depends on the DOM.
4.Order of Execution: It is designed to run before DOM mutations, allowing injected styles to take effect immediately without flicker.

Syntax:

useInsertionEffect(effect: () => (void | (() => void)), deps?: DependencyList)

effect: A function that executes synchronously during the render phase.
deps: An optional dependency array to control when the effect runs.


Best Practices:

1.Use Judiciously: useInsertionEffect should only be used when necessary, like injecting critical styles. Avoid using it for general side effects.
2.Avoid Blocking: Since it runs during the render phase, ensure the logic inside this hook is lightweight and doesn't block rendering.
3.CSS-in-JS Libraries: Works well with libraries that dynamically generate stylesheets.
4.Fallback to useEffect or useLayoutEffect: For non-styling-related DOM mutations, prefer useEffect or useLayoutEffect.

When to Avoid:

1.If your app doesn’t involve style injection or dynamic styles, you likely don’t need this hook.
2.Avoid using it for general-purpose logic that doesn't relate to style insertion.

By understanding and using useInsertionEffect appropriately, 
you can optimize your app's styling behavior and eliminate style-related flickering issues.
