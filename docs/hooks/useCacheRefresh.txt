The useCacheRefresh hook in React is part of React's experimental features associated with React Server Components and React Suspense. 
It allows developers to manually trigger cache refreshes for data that is cached by React.

What is useCacheRefresh?

React Server Components can cache data to improve performance. 
When the data needs to be updated, the useCacheRefresh hook can invalidate the cached data and force React to re-fetch or re-render it with the updated information.

When to Use useCacheRefresh?

Use this hook when you need to:

1.Refresh the cache for data after performing a mutation or other state-changing action.
2.Ensure that the UI reflects updated data from the server or backend.

Key Features:

1.Refreshes specific cached segments without requiring a full-page reload.
2.Optimizes re-fetching and re-rendering by focusing only on the affected components.

Syntax:

const refresh = useCacheRefresh();

refresh: This is the function returned by useCacheRefresh. 
You can call this function to refresh the cache.

Arguments:
key (optional): A unique key or identifier for the cached data you want to refresh. 
If not provided, all caches may be refreshed.


How It Works:

1.Server-Side Cache: The posts list is fetched and cached on the server using React Server Components.
2.Client-Side Trigger: When a new post is added (handleAddPost), the refreshCache function invalidates the cached posts list.
3.Re-Fetch: The PostsList component automatically re-fetches and renders the updated posts from the server.

Notes and Limitations:

1.Experimental: useCacheRefresh is not yet stable and is available only in experimental builds of React.
2.Server Components: This hook is closely tied to React's Server Components and may not be applicable in fully client-side rendered applications.
3.Caching Key Management: Proper cache key management is important to avoid unintended refreshes or stale data.

Benefits:

1.Efficiency: Refreshes only the affected cached segment, avoiding unnecessary network requests or re-renders.
2.User Experience: Ensures the UI remains responsive and updated without requiring a full reload.
