The useTransition hook is a React Hook introduced in React 18 for managing transitions, which allows you to mark certain state updates as non-urgent. 
These updates can be deferred, meaning React will prioritize more urgent updates (like user input or animations) over them. 
This is especially useful in scenarios where some state updates (like filtering a large list) can take longer and don't need to block the rendering of immediate feedback for the user.

Key Features of useTransition:

1.Start a Transition: The hook provides a startTransition function that wraps the state updates you want to treat as non-urgent.
2.Track the Transition State: It also provides a boolean isPending, which indicates whether the transition is still in progress.
3.Non-blocking Rendering: React will render the urgent updates immediately and defer the non-urgent ones, avoiding UI freezes.

Syntax:

const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();


Parameters and Return Value:

isPending: A boolean that is true while the transition is ongoing and false when it's complete.
startTransition: A function that you use to wrap non-urgent state updates.


Key Points to Note:

1.Concurrent Rendering: React schedules transitions using concurrent rendering, which enables smooth and responsive UIs.
2.Fallback UI: Use isPending to display fallback UI (like a spinner or loading message) during the transition.
3.Non-Blocking Input: Urgent updates like user input aren't blocked while transitions are processed.


By leveraging useTransition, you can create apps that feel more responsive and maintain great performance, even for expensive computations or rendering tasks.
