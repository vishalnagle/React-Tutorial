The useDeferredValue hook was introduced in React 18 to improve performance by deferring the processing of a value until the browser has idle time. 
It is primarily used for optimizing UI rendering in scenarios where frequent updates can lead to unnecessary re-renders and reduced performance.

How it Works:

useDeferredValue returns a deferred version of a value that might lag behind the original value if the rendering is busy.
The deferred value updates less frequently, allowing React to prioritize more urgent updates like user interactions over less critical updates like displaying new search results.

Key Points:

1.Debouncing vs useDeferredValue:

Debouncing: Delays updating a value by a fixed time.
useDeferredValue: React dynamically decides when to update the deferred value based on rendering workload.

2.Main Use Case:

Optimizing expensive computations or rendering operations, such as filtering a large list of items based on user input.

3.Behavior:

The hook doesn't introduce artificial delays. 
Instead, it defers updating the value only when necessary to ensure smoother UI interactions.

Syntax:

const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);

When to Use:

1.Use useDeferredValue when you want to reduce unnecessary rendering or processing without blocking user interactions.

2.Ideal for:

Search filters
Animations
Infinite scrolling
Expensive computations

When Not to Use
Avoid using it if:

Updates must be immediate and cannot be deferred.
Thereâ€™s no performance issue with frequent updates.
