The useReducer hook in React is a state management tool that is particularly useful for managing complex state logic. 
It is an alternative to the useState hook and is often preferred when:

1.You have a complex state structure.
2.State updates depend on the previous state.
3.You want to centralize and manage the logic in a reducer function, similar to Redux.
4.The useReducer hook works similarly to the Reducer pattern in Redux. 

It takes two arguments:

1.Reducer function: A pure function that takes the current state and an action and returns the new state.
2.Initial state: The starting value for your state.

The hook returns:
1.The current state.
2.A dispatch function to trigger actions.

Syntax:

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

Parameters:

1.reducer: A function (state, action) => newState that defines how the state is updated based on the action.
2.initialState: The initial value of the state.

Advantages of useReducer:

1.Centralized Logic: It keeps state logic in one place, making it easier to maintain.
2.Easier to Scale: For complex state management, useReducer provides better scalability than useState.
3.Predictable: The reducer function is a pure function, so the state changes are predictable and debuggable.

When to Use useReducer:

1.Managing complex state transitions.
2.Need for better separation of concerns between UI and state logic.
3.Scenarios requiring advanced actions like undo/redo.
